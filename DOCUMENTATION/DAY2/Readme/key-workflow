### **Key Workflows**

#### **2.1 User Registration**  
**Process:**  
- Users sign up via the frontend using Clerk for a seamless registration experience.  
- Registration details, including preferences for women, men, or kids' clothing, are stored in Sanity CMS.  
- This ensures personalized recommendations and efficient user management.  

#### **2.2 Product Browsing**  
**Process:**  
- Users navigate through clothing categories (women, men, kids) on the frontend.  
- Sanity CMS API fetches product data, including name, rental price, availability, description, and images.  
- Dynamic product listings are displayed, allowing users to filter by size, style, or occasion.  

#### **2.3 Order Placement**  
**Process:**  
- Users add clothing items to the cart and proceed to checkout.  
- Order details (selected items, rental duration, shipping address) are sent to Sanity CMS.  
- Payment is processed via Stripe, with options for cash on delivery or online payment.  
- A confirmation message is sent to the user's email, and the rental order is recorded in Sanity CMS for tracking.
